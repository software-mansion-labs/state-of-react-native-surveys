# Overall survey framework changes

1. Research the upgrade process
   1. how much the data model changes?
   2. how many adjustments to the questions set we need to make to run the up-to-date version of the survey?
   3. the same with the results?
   4. do we need to modernize the data we've collected in the previous editions? (I hope we don't have to adjust anything in them 🙏)
2. New features from the upstream survey part we might want to have
   1. Reading list
      1. adding questions
      2. summary on the final page of the survey
   2. Code previews
   3. Two steps `Never heard of it / Heard of it / Used it : Interested / Not interested` response type
   4. Skipping questions
   5. Survey completion tracking
   6. Comments for every question
   7. New `Other` answer in multiselect question that opens up a freeform input
   8. New freeform question type
   9. Features score on the final page of the survey
